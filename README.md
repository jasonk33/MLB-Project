Final Project for Data Fluency For All: Analysis of MLB game statistics

Using R, I performed analysis on data from all MLB games dating backing to 1871. The project entailed heavy data cleaning, data manipulation, and the creation of several visualizations and predictive models. Visualizations include bar graphs to represent the home field advantage and road attendacne affects of each team, as well as a parcoord graph to display the relationship between various team statistics and overall team run production. Naive Bayes models were created to predict whether a team had won and how many runs a team had scored based on statsitcs from the game. 
Results from the project can be viewed at: http://rpubs.com/jasonk33/237691
Data was acquired from retrosheet.org
